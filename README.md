## Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building and comparing multiple models for forecasting time series data. The goal is to understand patterns and trends within the data, preprocess it for stationarity, and apply different forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, and XGBoost. 

The models are compared using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to identify the best model for the given time series data.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Analysis and Cleaning**:
   - Initial exploration of the dataset is done using Pandas and Numpy to inspect the data.
   - Missing values are handled, and data types are converted to appropriate formats.
   - Outliers and anomalies are detected and treated if necessary.

2. **Visualization**:
   - We use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize the data, helping us understand trends, seasonal patterns, and any unusual behavior in the time series.
   - Visualizations like line plots, seasonal decomposition, and autocorrelation plots are used.

3. **Stationarity and Seasonality**:
   - The next step involves addressing stationarity in the data. Time series data must be stationary for many forecasting models, such as ARIMA.
   - Stationarity is tested using statistical tests like the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test**.
   - Seasonal components are removed or adjusted as needed to make the data stationary.

4. **Modeling**:
   - **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is used to forecast the data. The model is optimized using different values of the parameters (p, d, q).
   - **SARIMAX**: Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables is used to capture seasonal trends in the data.
   - **XGBoost**: A machine learning model based on gradient boosting, which is applied to time series forecasting. The model is trained using the historical data and used to make future predictions.

5. **Model Comparison**:
   - Models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, specifically **MSE** and **RMSE**.
   - The best performing model is chosen based on these metrics, with XGBoost yielding the best performance so far:
     - **MSE for XGBoost**: `20.89`
     - **RMSE for XGBoost**: `4.57`

6. **Next Steps**:
   - We can continue improving the models by adjusting hyperparameters or implementing other preprocessing techniques.
   - Different values of `p`, `q`, and `d` can be used for ARIMA and SARIMAX to capture more complex patterns.
   - Further optimization of the XGBoost model can be done through grid search, cross-validation, and feature engineering.
